### Sentiment Analysis via LSTM

**Introduction:**

Apply LSTM via keras to analyze the overall attitude of a short text message (positive or negative).

**Data:**

We use dataset supplied by Yelp. Yelp provides a platform that allows consumers to rate and review products and services from small businesses they have visited. All reviews in Yelp are written by real people. This dataset contains about 5 million reviews and the stars consumers give. The more stars mean consumers feel more positive towards this business. Therefore, the number of stars could be as the label to represent the attitude of corresponding review text. Among 5 million data, we selected 100,000 reviews saved as file `review_data.npy`.
